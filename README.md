War Game

Play the classic war game against the AI, There are 2 decks, player's deck is on the lower half, click on it to draw a card and send it to battle zone.
The Ai will also draw a card to fight against you, the card which has more value wins.
Possible values are 1-10 both included.
One on one card showdown is called a battle, winner takes both cards, the value of cards left in the deck is shown next to the deck.
The number of cards currently present in the battlefield is shown below the battlefield as "Cards At Stake"
If both cards are of same value during a battle, a war begins, you and AI both draw the number of cards equal to the card's value that started the war.
The drawing of card is done automatically, whoever wins the war wins all cards.
First player left with 0 cards loses the game.
During each battle after the winner is decided, a button appears which is labeled as "Your Turn" which should be clicked inorder to start next turn 
of drawing cards.

I have tested most of the functionality myself, but some bugs might be encountered, in that case you can revert back to me and I will fix them asap.

HAVE FUN !
